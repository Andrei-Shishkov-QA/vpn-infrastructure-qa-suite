    4. ИНТЕГРАЦИОННЫЙ ТЕСТ:
    Создаем маленький файл и реально пытаемся отправить его в Телеграм.
    Если придет 200 OK — значит, система доставки работает.

        SMOKE TEST (REQ-000): Verifies SSH connectivity to the server.

        This test covers multiple layers of the stack implicitly:
        1. Network Layer: IP is reachable.
        2. Transport Layer: Port 22 is open and accepting TCP connections.
        3. Application (SSH): SSH Daemon is running and accepts the handshake.
        4. Auth Layer: Credentials (root + password) are correct.
        5. Execution: System can fork a process ('hostname') and return stdout.

        If this test fails, further security auditing (REQ-001+) is impossible.

"
        REQ-002: Firewall (UFW) must be active.
        Logic: We check the command output 'ufw status' explicitly.
        We expect to see 'Status: active'. This covers both Ubuntu and Debian correctly,
        avoiding false negatives from systemd service status.

        REQ-004: OS Standardization (Ubuntu/Debian).
        Logic: Verify that the server runs a supported Linux distribution.
        This prevents 'configuration drift' where servers become too different to manage.
