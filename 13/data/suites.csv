        SMOKE TEST (REQ-000): Verifies SSH connectivity to the server.

        This test covers multiple layers of the stack implicitly:
        1. Network Layer: IP is reachable.
        2. Transport Layer: Port 22 is open and accepting TCP connections.
        3. Application (SSH): SSH Daemon is running and accepts the handshake.
        4. Auth Layer: Credentials (root + password) are correct.
        5. Execution: System can fork a process ('hostname') and return stdout.

        If this test fails, further security auditing (REQ-001+) is impossible.
